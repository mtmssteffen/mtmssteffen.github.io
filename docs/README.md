# Identify and predict patterns in migration of ancestors by century and country. 

Our ethinic identity is normally defined by a specific country or region our ancestors came from.  However, for many people their ancestors came from multiple countries and regions as peoples migrated and intermarried.  This is reflected in DNA tests which list multiple countries of origin for specfic gene traits.  But what was the path that lead from these countries of origin to who I am today?  That path is recorded in our family history, the genealogy of the line of ancestors going from us to these countries of origin.  Unlike DNA tests, our genealogy doesn't come with a one-page summary of all the steps from the past to the present.   

While most ancestors lived in the same location all their lives, at certain periods in history in certain countries family groups or individuals would move to a new country.  Visualizing the times and places of these major changes in ancestors lives can give insight into the life experiences that shaped their lives and lead to the places and times we now live in.  Genealogy records of life events such as birth and death dates and locations give the raw data for identifying these inflection points in our family's path.  However, this genealogy data is not in a consistent standard format, locations have changed names over the years and boundaries of countries have shifted, and many records give only dates but lack location.  

This project makes a tentative first step in filling out the gaps in ancestor records by modeling the patterns of which time periods and which locations were more likely to have movement from ancestral homelands.

    
## Data Sources / Data Understanding
Family history compiled, cleaned, labeled, merged, and analyzed from multiple sources from 2009 - 2024, and summarized in:  
https://github.com/mtmssteffen/dsnd-communicating-to-stakeholders-lesson
 - Ancestor_data.csv:  Genealogy of ancestors, uniquely ID each individual, giving family surname, gendter, birth & death year & location, IDs of parents, and an intepretation of the country of origin.
 - FamilyAtlasPlacesGeocode.csv:  List of raw locations from Ancestor_data run through the Family Atlas geocoding tool to generate standard location names and latitute-longitude.  About half of the raw locations had automated matches, and close matches required manual review and updating.
